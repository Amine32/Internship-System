# Gradle Wrapper JAR

In a real project, the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file would be located in this directory.

This file is a binary file that is generated by running the Gradle wrapper task:
```
gradle wrapper
```

For a complete migration from Maven to Gradle, you would need to:

1. Install Gradle locally
2. Run `gradle wrapper` to generate the wrapper files including this JAR
3. Commit all the generated files to version control

The Gradle wrapper allows users to run Gradle commands without having Gradle installed locally.
